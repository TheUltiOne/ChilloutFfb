# ChilloutFfb
Chillout FFB is a [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) mod for the [OpenGloves driver](https://github.com/LucidVR/opengloves-driver) by [LucidVR](https://github.com/LucidVR) (by [Lucas](https://github.com/lucas-vrtech)). They integrate the **force feedback** implentation into the *Prototype 4 gloves*, which you can build for only 60$ yourself by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yF-SJcg3zQ&ab_channel=LucasVRTech)!

### In simple words
With this mod, you'll be able to *feel* grabbed objects with force feedback. You **need** [OpenGloves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yF-SJcg3zQ&ab_channel=LucasVRTech) to do this.

### Developer things
This depends on [my library for OpenGloves](https://github.com/TheUltiOne/OpenGloves-Unity) and the *ChilloutFfb-Standalone.dll* file is built with ILMerge. If you want to use the library, just make sure to follow the MIT license.
